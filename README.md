# GameBoyTest

The majority of the code is using the tonc library, what should happen is you load up the program and rick astleys never gonna give you up plays through the speaker while showing the notes being played.

### Prerequisites

A GBA emulator or just some knowledge of how the gameboy advance works.

### Installing

Download as a zip and open the project, run the .gba file in a gameboy emulator, IMPORTANT make sure you have your sound turned way down and probably something to remind you of how the song actually sounds because even though it may be the correct notes, it's still pretty unrecognisable.

## Running the tests

Run in a GBA emulator
