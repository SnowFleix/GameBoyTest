# GameBoyTest

The majority of the code is using the tonc library, what should happen is you load up the program and rick astleys never gonna give you up plays through the speaker while showing the notes being played.

This an example of what I've been doing when learning GBA development, so far I've mostly been working through the documents given on the tonc website as well as other online resources. I am still learning this hence no larger projects or anything of any real substance/full games that I made.

### Prerequisites

A GBA emulator or just some knowledge of how the gameboy advance works.

### Installing

Download as a zip and open the project, run the .gba file in a gameboy emulator, IMPORTANT make sure you have your sound turned way down and probably something to remind you of how the song actually sounds because even though it may be the correct notes, it's still pretty unrecognisable.

If you want to build the project yourself make sure you have gbadevpro kit installed then just run make

## Running the tests
